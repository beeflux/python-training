'''

class LargestProduct contains method for calculating up, down, left, right,
and vertical elements product. For each direction methods have been defined
as up_calc, down_calc, left_calc, right_calc and vertical_calc

Here we are supposed to the greatest product of four adjacent numbers
in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20Ã—20 grid.
this we have defined a method for each direction. We also have created an
empty dictionary where we will be storing the resultant product as key and the 
digits involved in the product as value(this makes easy to understand what's happening).
-> In case of up direction, we start from 339th index and continue until 60th index.
On doing so only, we will have four adjacent elements. 
-> In case of down direction, we start from 60th index and continue till the 339th 
index. On doing so only, we will have four adjacent elements. 
-> In case of right direction, we start from 0th index till the 396th index.
On doing so only, we will have four adjacent elements.
-> In case of left direction we start from the 339th index until 2nd index. only
on doing so we will have 4 elements to multiply.
-> In case of vertical direction we start from the 0th index till 16th index right in column
and 0th index till 320th index down in row and only until the 336th index. Only on doing so
we will have four elements for multiplying
